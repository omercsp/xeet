# Ongoing

# Missing features
- Add coverage testing (UT + test)
- Exec step: save diff file
- Allow a test to be excluded from an 'all' run
- Add variable matrix support
- Add test randomization
- Add server mode
- Add save results to file option
-- Add compare with last run time support
-- Add run only last failed tests
-- Add log retention policy option (number of runs to keep)
- Add test CLI editor
- Add test rename capability (should rename result file as well)
- Add skip test command (should be able to skip a test based on a condition)
- Add option to stop on first failure
- Add option to create test sequences, not necessarily from the same group, outside of test defintions
- Add failure condition based on maximum time to run
- Add auto groups according to file setting
- Add error messages wrapping, to avoid <MSG>: <MSG>: <MSG>... in the output. Instead:
  <MSG:
  ↳ <MSG>
    ↳ <MSG>
- Add test dependcies, so that a test can be run only if another test ran. Additonal constraint can extend this
  relationship to only run if the previous test passed. Beware of loop dependencies.
- Add strict ordering of tests when run by name. Should rely on the depency system: when strict ordering is set,
  create an implicit dependency between the tests, so that the next test can only run if the previous one ran.
