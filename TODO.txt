# Ongoing

# Missing features
- Add coverage testing (UT + test)
- Platform specific support
- Exec step: save diff file
- Allow a test to be excluded from an 'all' run
- Add variable matrix support
- Add colored log support
- Add quiet mode 1 - no unrelated test output (splash and so)
- Add quiet mode 2 - no output at all but errors
- Add quiet mode 3 - no output at all
- Add parallel execution
- Add test randomization
- Add server mode
- Add time output
- Add save results to file option
-- Add compare with last run time support
-- Add run only last failed tests
-- Add log retention policy option (number of runs to keep)
- Add test CLI editor
- Add test rename capability (should rename result file as well)
- Add pre/post suite execution commands
- Add skip test command (should be able to skip a test based on a condition)
- Seperate test running from UI (CLI) and infra. The latter should be able to run for other clients, hence
  it should yield the results in a format that can be consumed by the client.
- Migrate all the testing components to be plugin based (pre-test, test, verify, post-test)
- Add multiple iterarion test
- Add option to stop on first failure
- Add option to create test sequences, not necessarily from the same group, outside of test defintions
